  description: The ISIS On Board computer (IOBC) is a flight-proven, high-performance
    processing unit based around an ARM9 processor with a speed of 400 MHz, making
    it one of the most capable on-board computers for CubeSats. Its pluggable daughter
    board offers additional flexibility and customizability by providing a wide range
    of extra interfaces for payloads, sensors or actuators in a compact form factor.
