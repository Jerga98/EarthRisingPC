  description: "UHF Digital SatCOM utilizes a half-duplex architecture with a high-performance
    low power consumption transceiver which is controlled by a dedicated Cortex \u2013
    M4 MCU. The radio uses the ultra-high frequency band (UHF) that is programmable
    in 430 to 440 MHz range. The receiver has an excellent sensitivity of -120 dBm
    at 9600 baud rate and the transmitter supports high throughput data communication
    in narrowband channels with GDSK, FSK (including G3RUH), MSK and OOK modulations."
