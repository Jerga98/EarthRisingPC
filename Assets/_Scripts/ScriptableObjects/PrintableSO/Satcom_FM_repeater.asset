  description: Right after the repeater is activated voice/CW message is transmitted
    once. Later the message is being transmitted repeatedly every 4 minutes if uplink
    (CQ) signal is detected. Repeater can share single reception antenna with other
    receivers working on the similar band through passive, therefore highly reliable
    electronic splitter circuit.
