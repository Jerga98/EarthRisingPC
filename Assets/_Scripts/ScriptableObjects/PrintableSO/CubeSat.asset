  description: A CubeSat is a class of miniaturized satellite based around a form
    factor consisting of 10 cm cubes. CubeSats have a mass of no more than 2 kg per
    unit, and often use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for their electronics
    and structure. CubeSats are put into orbit by deployers on the International
    Space Station, or launched as secondary payloads on a launch vehicle.
