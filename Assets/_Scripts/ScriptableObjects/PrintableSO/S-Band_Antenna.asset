  description: The S-band patch antenna is a compact, low mass solution suitable
    for the commercial S-band frequency range of 2200-2290 MHz. This passive antenna
    is suitable for any CubeSat platform. It is an off the shelf antenna designed
    to complement the ISIS S-band transmitter for telemetry and payload data transmissions.
    The antenna is mounted onto a Rogers PCB, ideal for high-frequency RF circuitry
    ensuring fewer losses than traditional FR-4 PCBS.
