  description: The VHF uplink/UHF downlink transceiver is a full duplex communication
    system for CubeSat TT&C applications. The radio can operate in commercial and
    amateur bands of the VHF/UHF frequency spectrum. It is low power, low mass, and
    highly configurable, offering the flexibility of changing data rates and frequencies
    in flight. This radio is tailored for CubeSat missions and cross-compatible with
    other subsystems such as onboard computers and antenna systems. Flight proven
    since 2016.
