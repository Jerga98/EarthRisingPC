  description: The Linear EPS Module is a low-cost Electrical Power System (EPS)
    with 10-20Wh of battery energy. It is designed to power a CubeSat stack of modules
    during development, and provides attached modules with +7.4Vdc (nominal), +5Vdc
    and +3.3Vdc rails. Recharging is via the built-in microUSB connector or from
    system +5V_USB. A three-segment LED bargraph is used to indicate progress when
    in charging mode and State-of-Charge (SOC) when in discharging mode. An optional
    extra battery doubles its energy capacity from 10Wh to 20Wh.
