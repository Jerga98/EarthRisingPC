  description: NanoAvionics UHF Antenna System consists of RF Splitter and 4 monopole
    antennae. RF Splitter is a key element in turnstile antenna systems that performs
    impedance matching and splits one RF signal into a phasing network in order to
    form a single circular polarized antenna. This results in an almost omnidirectional
    radiation pattern with no blind spots, which can cause signal fading due to satellite
    tumbling. An aperture can be provided inside the splitter board for hardware
    integration purposes.
